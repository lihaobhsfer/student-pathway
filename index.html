				<h3 style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">Completeness: Is the data complete?</h3>
				<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
					The data is complete in the way that it can satisfy our need for answering the questions, which means it has the
					columns of: problem view, latency, first step, problem id, hint level, KC labels, and performance. However, within
					the particular student interactions, there are some missing values that occur due to OLI errors or student input
					errors. As OLI also only measures interaction time with the student, it is difficult to gauge students engagement
					with the instructional materials.
					<br><br>
					During Exploratory Data analysis, we also discovered that only 28 out of the 55 students in the course had
					completed the post-test, so we decided to accumulate other performance data to measure learning such as the final
					exam which was completed by almost all students. A large number of students have not completed either the pre or
					the post today.

				<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
					The course data on OLI is on DataShop and stored as “private”, as such it can only be accessed after seeking
					permission from the owner, Norman Bier.
					<br>
					The student-performance data is confidential, only the instructor and administrators of the dataset have access to
					it. We had to ask for special permission to access this data and it was anonymized before we received it.

				<h3 style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;"><strong>Coherence: Is the data coherent?</strong></h3>
				<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
					The data was not very coherent at first. But it has been cleaned by our team members. Firstly, we eliminated all
					the columns in the student-problem dataset that are not needed. We then read the student-problem dataset and the
					performance data into a pandas DataFrame. After that, we join the two dataset together on anonymous student id.
					Looking further into the data, we found a module on academic integrity and ethics with problems that are not
					relevant to the actual learning, thus we also dropped those rows. Finally, we dropped all rows that contain null
					values.

					This processing has made the data cleaner and more coherent.

				<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
					The data is correct because all transaction and students behavior, including each step they take, how much time it
					take for them to do each problem, and their hint-asking behaviors are accurately recorded down by the Datashop
					automatically, minimizing the possibility of human error. By comparing OLI scores and completion rates with
					performance data we were further able to check the validity of the data.
					<br><br>
					We verified this correctness by plotting a number of graphs and validating discrete statistics such as averages
					and ranges of scores, etc. A detailed discussion of this processing is available in the Exploratory Analysis
					section below.

					<p>There is a strong correlation (m = 0.4912) between completion rate (percentage of questions completed on

						a number of students who have high score but low completion rate, upon further analysis it was discovered that

						Finally, we plotted the OLI completion rate and performance against performance on the written assessment to
						verify if there was transfer between the two. We saw a very strong correlation between the performance on OLI
						against the performance on written assessments, with the few outliers again being students who had performed well
						on the pretest and did not have high completion rate due to this.

					The nodes in the diagram represent the different modules of the course. The links represent the number of students
					that move from one module to another. The solid links show forward movement and the dashed links represent when
					students go back to a module after completing it the first time. The size of the nodes and links represent the
					number of students who take that path. <br><br />
					You can interact with the nodes and move them around to see links more clearly. Hovering over links will reveal
					their counts in tooltips and hovering over nodes will highlight all source links to that node. Clicking on a node
					will allow you to highlight all target links that go out from that node. Link highlights can be reset by clicking
					any node. <br /><br />
					<!-- By visualizing the different clusters of paths, students can be categorized based on their completion behavior.

						<br>
						<strong>Insights:</strong><br>
						Following the general pattern, there is clear group of students who follow the recommended path as shown by the
						thick link. At the top left of the graph it is also easy to see a number of advanced students who skip the
						introduction lessons on loops and lists. Nodes which are small and pushed to the side like concurrency, common
						errors and logic are also key aareas for intervention as not enough students are attempting these modules.<br><br>
						Another interesting insight from this visualization is the idea that making decisions is linked to different
						previous modules and being a complicated module results in students going back to other modules to recap as shown
						by the large number of backwards links. The recommended intervention in this case would be to examine the
						contents of the making decisions module to decided if it requires more scaffolding or whether recap notes from
						other modules should be directly inserted into this.

						<strong>Insights:</strong><br>
						The fall course size was much larger than the other two terms (more than 4 times the number of students), hence
						the abundance of links. Once again we immediately see the large link of students returning to the making
						decisions module, hoghlighting that it is an area for improvement, even across terms. <br> Like we saw in the
						summer, there is one clear path most students follow, an early group that skips introduction slides and
						atttrition is clear. <br><br>
						What is also obeserved is that many students skipped the post test and also the mid modules like Recursion, Data
						Representation and Encryption which show as very small nodes. <br /><br>

						As before, instructional designers should consider Scaffolding the course so that novice learners and advanced
						learners can both take advatage of the online class.

								1) Low achieving students started struggling very early, on their first course module- For loops. (The third
								block on the graph, because the first two block are introduction and pretest). We can see from the brown block
								that showed for low achieving students, these are much longer, which means they have been visiting that for

						<strong>Evaluation and Insights:</strong><br>
						<div style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
							<p>This is not a transparent visualization, and probably also not too self-explanatory. But it has its
								advantage
								in that:<br /> <br />
								1) It is showing four variables at the same time: <br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Student id<br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) normalized error<br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) final performance <br />
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) problem name. <br />
								Therefore it is a very comprehensive graphic which has a lot of information in it.</p><br />
							<p>2) It can visualize everybody’s final performance in a very conspicuous way: by using red and green. The
								darker the green, means the students performed better. The darker the red, means the students perform worse.
								This is correlated with our common sense that red signals warning, risks and green signals passing and safety.
								Therefore, from the graphics, we can easily see which students are not performing well. And which particular
								module are they struggling with.</p>
							<p>3) One example to understand how to use this visualization would be student with id AE. The large size of
								squares for this student shows the completion rate is high. However, we can see from the axis that the total
								score for this student is poor (around 72% which is well below class average). <br>Upon examining the
								visualization we can see that this is due to the fact that the student has a very high error rate and is
								attempting questions incorrectly at a high frequency. We can then use the visualization to pinpoint the areas
								that the student needs to improve in such as Time-Efficiency, Encryption and Lists. </p>
							<p>4) Another way to use this visualization is to examine a particular module across students. For example: The
								Time-efficiency module is clearly very troublesome for low scoring students while high scoring students tend to
								not make errors on practice problems for this module. On the other hand the Encryption module seems to be hard
								for everyone and would require some re-evaluation to understand why. </p>

						<strong>Insights:</strong><br>
							<ol style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
								<li>
									1)	Low achieving students started struggling very early, on their first course module- For loops. (The third block on the graph, because the first two block are introduction and pretest). We can see from the brown block that showed for low achieving students, these are much longer, which means they have been visiting that for loops module a lot of times. This early struggling shows they are struggling, and may indicate that they may not do as well as others. So educators can take this as a sign, and give timely help to these struggling students who are using more time than others.
								</li><br>
								<li>
								2)	High achieving students (judging from the total- final performance), tend to do more modules. As we can see from the visual, in the upper part, there are more colorful blocks, which means these students visited modules more completely. We can also see that the time they take are more balanced.

					<p>These are observational studies that are conducted in an ex-post facto manner as the data is already available
						on DataShop.</p>

					<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;"><strong><u>Hypotheses to be tested: </u></strong><br /><br />


						<strong>Null Hypothesis 1:</strong> There is no statistically significant relationship between completion rate of
						problems and students’ final performance.<br>
						<strong>Independent Variable:</strong> Completion Rate (percentage of course materials completed)<br>
						<strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> Total Score (Final performance)<br><br>


						<strong>Null Hypothesis 2:</strong> There is no statistically significant relationship between students’ time
						spent and students’ final performance.<br>
						<strong>Independent Variable:</strong>Time spent (Number of problems * avg. time spent per problem)<br>
						<strong>Dependent Variable:</strong>Total Score (Final performance)

						<br>
					</p>


					<br>
					<p style="width:70; margin-left:15%; text-align:left;">
						<strong>Statistical Evidence:</strong><br>

						For hypothesis 1: <br />

						<!-- <img class="img-responsive" src="images/hyp1.png" style="width: 70%;"></img><br /> -->
						Equation: <strong>Avg(Total) = 0.142344 * Time-Spent + 76.8668<br></strong>

						P value:<strong> 0.0029142 **</strong> <br />
						Evaluation:<strong> The correlation value is more prominent when some outliers are removed as can be experimented

							have. Due to vast prior knowledge, they are not engaged in the course but still get a high total score. </strong>
						<br />
						Conclusion:<strong> Reject null hypothesis. Completion rate of problems is positively correlated with students’

						Evaluation:<strong> The time spent on questions is not a good indicator of performance in any way. This is

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<span class="byline">Observations, Insights, Limitations and Future Work </span>
				</div>

				<h3>Observations and Insights</h3>
				<div class="boxX">
					<p>Completion rate is a better indicator than time spent to predict a students’ final performance on the course,
						supported by statistics of correlation variable (slope) and p value. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="boxX">

					<p>low-achieving students tend to start struggling very early on about some relatively easy modules, such as “for
						loop” in this course. </p>

				</div>
				<div class="boxX">

					<p>In this course while most people did badly in the pre-test, the majority of them did better in their post-test.</p>

					<!-- <a href="#" class="button button-alt">More Info</a> -->
				</div>

				<h3>Generalization Potential</h3>
				<div class="boxX">
					<p>These visualization have been designed to be as easy to create for a non-practitioner of data science. The aim of this part of the project is to create a simple set of steps that any instructional designer can use to create these visualizations from any DataShop data set. </p>
					<p>For the first visualization (Sankey diagram) the data needs to be cleaned using the data pipeline mentioned above. We plan to open source the code used in this project to clean the data into the required format (which uses Python and Pandas). Currently weightage on the Sankey diagram is done with just the student count, but student performance, time spent, and other metrics could also be used to weight the links depending on the domain.</p>
					<p>For the other visualizations, Tableau is a ready to use format and our visualization workbooks are public and can be accessed by anyone. In order for the visualizations to work in a plug and play manner, data shop data will need to be exported (at the Student-Problem level) and then combined with performance data. While we have combined a number of performance parameters, both offline and online, in our analysis, the visualizations will still work if this combination is done simply by joining student final scores (out of 100) with their student Ids on the downloaded DataShop file. </p>
					<p>This generalization potential can be seen above where we re-created the Sankey diagrams for two other semesters of the Introduction to Programming course, and each of these visualizations was created without writing any code, in less than 30 minutes. </p>
				</div>



				<h3>Limitations and Future Work</h3>
				<div class="boxX">
					<p>This is only one course in several specific time periods, with limited students. The conclusion about learning
						pathways can benefit from larger amount of data to yield more explicit and solid pattern.</p>

					<p>It is hard to judge the generalizability of our conclusion three because it is largely specific to this course.
					</p>
					<p>The Sankey diagram is capable of displaying a macro picture, but in its current form it is difficult to
						generalize intuition from the diagram. </p>

					<p>For online course with more than hundreds of students, such as MOOCs, further data aggregation is needed to
						avoid high complexity of the sankey diagram.</p>

					<p>In the future, it may be possible to visualize for different courses across different domains to see if common
						pattern exist about learning pathways. Depending on further analysis and user studies with instructional
						designers, the Sankey diagram can be modified to include color and other features to communicate more information
						at a glance.</p>

					<p>We also plan to move these visualizations into the LearnSphere environment to allow direct integration with all
						DataShop datasets.</p>
