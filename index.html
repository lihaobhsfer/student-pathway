					<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
						The data is complete in the way that it can satisfy our need for answering the questions, which means it has the columns of: problem view, latency, first step, problem id, hint level, KC labels, and performance. However, within the particular student interactions, there are some missing values that occur due to OLI errors or student input errors. As OLI also only measures interaction time with the student, it is difficult to gauge students engagement with the instructional materials.
						<br><br>
						During Exploratory Data analysis, we also discovered that only 28 out of the 55 students in the course had completed the post-test, so we decided to accumulate other performance data to measure learning such as the final exam which was completed by almost all students. A large number of students have not completed either the pre or the post today.

					<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
						The course data on OLI is on DataShop and stored as “private”, as such it can only be accessed after seeking permission from the owner, Norman Bier.
						<br>
						The student-performance data is confidential, only the instructor and administrators of the dataset have access to it. We had to ask for special permission to access this data and it was anonymized before we received it.

					<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
						The data was not very coherent at first. But it has been cleaned by our team members. Firstly, we eliminated all the columns in the student-problem dataset that are not needed. We then read the student-problem dataset and the performance data into a pandas DataFrame. After that, we join the two dataset together on anonymous student id. Looking further into the data, we found a module on academic integrity and ethics with problems that are not relevant to the actual learning, thus we also dropped those rows. Finally, we dropped all rows that contain null values.

					<p style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
						The data is correct because all transaction and students behavior, including each step they take, how much time it take for them to do each problem, and their hint-asking behaviors are accurately recorded down by the Datashop automatically, minimizing the possibility of human error. By comparing OLI scores and completion rates with performance data we were further able to check the validity of the data.
						<br><br>
						We verified this correctness by plotting a number of graphs and validating discrete statistics such as averages and ranges of scores, etc. A detailed discussion of this processing is available in the Exploratory Analysis section below.

				<span style="text-align:left;">
					<p>There is a strong correlation (m = 0.4912) between completion rate (percentage of questions completed on OLI)and total score (final grade). This simple analysis validates the effectiveness of the course and highlights a number of students who have high score but low completion rate, upon further analysis it was discovered that these students have high pre-test scores. This makes sense as a high pretest score implies prior knowledge which can justify high scores without high completion rate.

						Finally, we plotted the OLI completion rate and performance against performance on the written assessment to verify if there was transfer between the two. We saw a very strong correlation between the performance on OLI against the performance on written assessments, with the few outliers again being students who had performed well on the pretest and did not have high completion rate due to this.

						<strong>How to Use:</strong><br />
						The nodes in the diagram represent the different modules of the course. The links represent the number of students
						that move from one module to another. The solid links show forward movement and the dashed links represent when
						students go back to a module after completing it the first time. The size of the nodes and links represent the
						number of students who take that path. <br><br />
						You can interact with the nodes and move them around to see links more clearly. Hovering over links will reveal
						their counts in tooltips and hovering over nodes will highlight all source links to that node. Clicking on a node
						will allow you to highlight all target links that go out from that node. Link highlights can be reset by clicking
						any node. <br /><br />
						By visualizing the different clusters of paths, students can be categorized based on their completion behavior.
						From our analysis we found that, generall speaking, there will be one thick central path that most students will
						follow, a small splinter cell of advanced students who will split early from the group to skip the introductory
						lessons and a very small group of high effort students who will approach all modules. <br> The

							<br>
							<strong>Insights:</strong><br>
							Following the general pattern, there is clear group of students who follow the recommended path as shown by the
							thick link. At the top left of the graph it is also easy to see a number of advanced students who skip the
							introduction lessons on loops and lists. Nodes which are small and pushed to the side like concurrency, common
							errors and logic are also key aareas for intervention as not enough students are attempting these modules.<br />
							Another interesting insight from this visualization is the idea that making decisions is linked to different
							previous modules and being a complicated module results in students going back to other modules to recap as shown
							by the large number of backwards links. The recommended intervention in this case would be to examine the contents
							of the making decisions module to decided if it requires more scaffolding or whether recap notes from other
							modules should be directly inserted into this.

							<strong>Insights:</strong><br>
							The fall course size was much larger than the other two terms (more than 4 times the number of students), hence the abundance of links. Once again we immediately see the large link of students returning to the making decisions module, hoghlighting that it is an area for improvement, even across terms. <br> Like we saw in the summer, there is one clear path most students follow, an early group that skips introduction slides and atttrition is clear. <br>
							What is also obeserved is that many students skipped the post test and also the mid modules like Recursion, Data Representation and Encryption which show as very small nodes. <br />
		
							As before, instructional designers should consider Scaffolding the course so that novice learners and advanced learners can both take advatage of the online class.

							<strong>Insights:</strong><br>
							<ol style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
								<li>
									1) Low achieving students started struggling very early, on their first course module- For loops. (The third block on the graph, because the first two block are introduction and pretest). We can see from the brown block that showed for low achieving students, these are much longer, which means they have been visiting that for loops module a lot of times. This early struggling shows they are struggling, and may indicate that they may not do as well as others. So educators can take this as a sign, and give timely help to these struggling students who are using more time than others.
								</li><br>
								<li>
									2) High achieving students (judging from the total- final performance), tend to do more modules. As we can see from the visual, in the upper part, there are more colorful blocks, which means these students visited modules more completely. We can also see that the time they take are more balanced. While if you look at the low-achieving students, you can see that there are more white space in their pathways, which means they have missed a lot of modules. This can lead to drop in their final performance. Also, as you can see from the graphics, the time use of low-achieving students are not as balanced as high-achieving ones. There tend to be some really long blocks, which could possibly mean that they are struggling.</li>
								<li><br>
									3) However, there are also some anomaly, such as the one low-achieving student who scored 70 but did almost all modules. This could be a indicator of wheel-spinning.<br /><br />

								<li>This is not a transparent visualization, and probably also not too self-explanatory. But it has its advantage
									in that:<br /> <br />
									1) It is showing four variables at the same time: <br />
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Student id<br />
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) normalized error<br />
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) final performance <br />
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) problem name. <br />
									Therefore it is a very comprehensive graphic which has a lot of information in it.</li><br />
								<li>2) It can visualize everybody’s final performance in a very conspicuous way: by using red and green. The
									darker the green, means the students performed better. The darker the red, means the students perform worse. This is correlated with our common sense that red signals warning, risks and green signals passing and safety. Therefore, from the graphics, we can easily see which students are not performing well. And which particular
									module are they struggling with.</li>
								<li>3) One example to understand how to use this visualization would be student with id AE. The large size of squares for this student shows the completion rate is high. However, we can see from the axis that the total score for this student is poor (around 72% which is well below class average). <br>Upon examining the
									visualization we can see that this is due to the fact that the student has a very high error rate and is attempting questions incorrectly at a high frequency. We can then use the visualization to pinpoint the areas that the student needs to improve in such as Time-Efficiency, Encryption and Lists. </li>
								<li>4) Another way to use this visualization is to examine a particular module across students. For example: The Time-efficiency module is clearly very troublesome for low scoring students while high scoring students tend to not make errors on practice problems for this module. On the other hand the Encryption module seems to be hard for everyone and would require some re-evaluation to understand why. </li>

						<strong>Insights:</strong><br>
							<ol style="text-align:left; width: 70%;margin-left:15%;">
								<li>
									1)	Low achieving students started struggling very early, on their first course module- For loops. (The third block on the graph, because the first two block are introduction and pretest). We can see from the brown block that showed for low achieving students, these are much longer, which means they have been visiting that for loops module a lot of times. This early struggling shows they are struggling, and may indicate that they may not do as well as others. So educators can take this as a sign, and give timely help to these struggling students who are using more time than others.
								</li><br>
								<li>
								2)	High achieving students (judging from the total- final performance), tend to do more modules. As we can see from the visual, in the upper part, there are more colorful blocks, which means these students visited modules more completely. We can also see that the time they take are more balanced. 
								While if you look at the low-achieving students, you can see that there are more white space in their pathways, which means they have missed a lot of modules. This can lead to drop in their final performance. Also, as you can see from the graphics, the time use of low-achieving students are not as balanced as high-achieving ones. There tend to be some really long blocks, which could possibly mean that they are struggling.</li>
								<li><br>
		
								 3) 	However, there are also some anomaly, such as the one low-achieving student who  scored 70 but did almost all modules. This could be a indicator of wheel-spinning.

							P value:<strong> 0.782187</strong> <br />
							Evaluation:<strong> The time spent on questions is not a good indicator of performance in any way. This is

								To further clean the data and improve the quality: firstly, we eliminated all the columns in the student-problem

								further into the data, we found a module on academic integrity and ethics with problems that are not relevant to
