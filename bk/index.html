            <p class="lead">Low achieving students started struggling very early, on their first course module --- For loops. (The third, yellow-brown block on the graph). We can see from the brown block that showed for low achieving students, these are much longer, which means they have been visiting that for loops module a lot of times. This early struggling shows they are struggling, and may indicate that they may not do as well as others. So educators can take this as a sign, and give timely help to these struggling students who are using more time than others.</p>
            <p class="lead">High achieving students (judging from the total- final performance), tend to do more modules. As we can see from the visual, in the upper part, there are more colorful blocks, which means these students visited modules more completely. We can also see that the time they take are more balanced.</p>
            <p class="lead">While looking at the low-achieving students, you can see that there are more white space in their pathways, which means they have missed a lot of modules. This can lead to drop in their final performance. Also, as you can see from the graphics, the time use of low-achieving students are not as balanced as high-achieving ones. There tend to be some really long blocks, which could possibly mean that they are struggling.</p>
            <p class="lead">However, there are also some anomaly, such as the one low-achieving student who scored 70 while did almost all modules. This could be a indicator of wheel-spinning.</p>

            <p class="lead">It is showing four variables at the same time: a) Student id, b) normalized error, c) final performance  d) problem name. Therefore it is a very comprehensive graphic which has a lot of information in it.</p>
            <p class="lead">it can visualize everybody’s final performance in a very conspicuous way: by using red and green. The darker the green, means the students performed better. The darker the red, means the students perform worse. This is correlated with our common sense that red signals warning, risks and green signals passing and safety. Therefore, from the graphics, we can easily see which students are not performing well. And which particular module are they struggling with.</p>

            <p class="lead">In this sheet, it shows that student completion rate is positively correlated with their final performance, and that completion rate is more telling than latency.</p>

            <h2>About This Dataset</h2>
              <h3>Accountability</h3>
                <h4>Where does this data come from?</h4>
                <p class="lead">This is student course interaction data that came from OLI through DataShop. It is for the course Introduction to Principles of Computing with Python, a blended learning course that has both online and offline components. This course is primarily for undergraduate students at CMU and the particular data that we are using is from the summer term of 2016.</p>
                <p class="lead">To answer our questions, we combine two datasets, one is about student-performance which contains data about the individual scores, class mean and S.D. of scores on the different assessments, both online and offline. The other dataset is logs of student actions on OLI which can be used to analyze learning pathways.</p>
                <p class="lead">Link for Edited Student Performance data: <a href=" https://drive.google.com/open?id=16oA5A81eRZ4EGMrvIcJFyscKY1wlLLGU " target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=16oA5A81eRZ4EGMrvIcJFyscKY1wlLLGU</a></p>
                <p class="lead">Link for Combined Performance and Student Interaction data: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tTeal-sFek3V_3kwilylNb6lJNp10B2k " target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tTeal-sFek3V_3kwilylNb6lJNp10B2k</a></p>
              <h4>Who has access to it?</h4>
                <p class="lead">The course data on OLI is on DataShop and stored as “private”, as such it can only be accessed after seeking permission from the owner, Norman Bier.</p>
                <p class="lead">The student-performance data is confidential, only the instructor and administrators of the dataset have access to it. We had to ask for special permission to access this data and it was anonymized before we received it.</p>
              <h3>Completeness: Is the data complete?</h3>
                <p class="lead">The data is complete in the way that it can satisfy our need for answering the questions, which means it has the columns of: problem view, time spent (latency), first step, problem id, hint level, KC labels, and performance. However, within the particular student interactions, there are some missing values that occur due to OLI errors or student input errors. Further, this data also only covers one class from one semester and as such, is not a complete representation of the course.</p>
                <p class="lead">During Exploratory Data analysis, we also discovered that only 28 out of the 55 students in the course had completed the post-test, so we decided to accumulate other performance data to measure learning such as the final exam which was completed by almost all students.</p>
              <h3>Coherence: Is the data coherent?</h3>
                <p class="lead">The data was not very coherent at first. But it has been cleaned by our team members. Firstly, we eliminated all the columns in the student-problem dataset that are not needed. We then read the student-problem dataset and the performance data into a pandas DataFrame. After that, we join the two dataset together on anonymous student id. Looking further into the data, we found a module on academic integrity and ethics with problems that are not relevant to the actual learning, thus we also dropped those rows. Finally, we dropped all rows that contain null values.</p>
                <p class="lead">This processing has made the data cleaner and more coherent.</p>
                <p class="lead">For the sankey diagram that shows student pathways to work properly, we had to further aggregate the data. This process might cause the quality to slightly suffer. However, other analyses are performed with the high-quality, cleaned dataset.</p>
              <h3>Correctness: Is the data correct?</h3>
                <p class="lead">The data is correct because all transaction and students behavior, including each step they take, how much time it take for them to do each problem, and their hint-asking behaviors are accurately recorded down by the Datashop automatically, minimizing the possibility of human error. By comparing OLI scores and completion rates with performance data we were further able to check the validity of the data.</p>
                <p class="lead">We verified this correctness by plotting a number of graphs and validating discrete statistics such as averages and ranges of scores, etc. A detailed discussion of this processing is available in the Exploratory Analysis section below.</p>
